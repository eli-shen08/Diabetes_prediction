# Diabetes_prediction
Predicting if a person is diabetic based on medical data .
I have used seaborn for data visualisation.
I have also used standard scaler to scale the features .
Here i have used Supported Vector Machine as an appropriate ML algorithm.
0 = Non-Diabetic , 1 = Diabetic.
I have also created a prediction system .
